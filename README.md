# Coding Quiz

## Description

The coding quiz was created to incorporate all the skills I have been obtaining in my Coding Bootcamp. Although unfinished at its current state, I have practiced with Web APIs and the use of JavaScript for building websites outside of the main index.html file. Working without starter code has proven difficult for myself, although I am confident that I will continue to push through and complete this course successfully.

This quiz, although short, may help with some basic knowledge of coding and bring out a little competitiveness within oneself.

## Usage

As the project is not completed at this time, the following will be stated as if the project IS complete -

A user may take this short quiz by clicking 'Start,' to which they are presented with 5 questions. A timer begins to count down, and the faster the user answers all the questions, the higher their potential score - given they don't make any mistakes. If an incorrect answer is selected, 15 seconds will be deducted from the clock, resulting in a lower final score. When the quiz is completed, the user may input their name to save their score to the local website.

## Credits

There was no starter code provided for this assignment, however, a Calendly Tutor for the course by the name of Scott Everett helped me get started and I would not have gotten even this far without his help.<br />Our TA, Nirav Venkatesan, also helped me out significantly with the bugs of my quiz presenting the questions themselves. 
Ask BCS was another great resource thanks to Jerromy and Drew <br />Thank you all!
